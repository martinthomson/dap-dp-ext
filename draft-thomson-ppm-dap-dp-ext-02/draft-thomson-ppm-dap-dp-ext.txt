    Distributed Aggregation Protocol (DAP) Report Binding Extensions
                  draft-thomson-ppm-dap-dp-ext-latest

Abstract

   Report extensions to the Distributed Aggregation Protocol (DAP) are
   defined to support new modes of operation for the protocol.  This
   includes a batched submission mode where an intermediary can collect
   reports prior to settling on an exact task configuration.  It also
   includes more flexibility for modes where a differential privacy
   mechanism is applied as part of the aggregation process.  Report
   extensions bind the content of reports to the chosen options to
   ensure that the guarantees that both DAP and differential privacy
   provide are maintained.

1.  Introduction

   The core Distributed Aggregation Protocol (DAP) [DAP] is suited to a
   deployment model where reports are submitted directly to the leader
   as they are generated.

   DAP report extensions can be used to enable alternative deployment
   models and approaches.  This document defines a set of extensions to
   enable two key changes to how DAP is used:

   *  A operating mode where an intermediary is responsible for
      gathering reports and performing batch submissions for
      aggregation.

   *  A operating mode where DAP is part of a differentially-private
      system where the differential privacy mechanism is applied as part
      of the aggregation process.

   No changes are needed to enable batched report submission in DAP.
   The challenge is that DAP assumes that clients know all the details
   of the aggregation task when generating reports.  The late_binding
   report extension (Section 3) loosens this requirement, allowing the
   intermediary to make some choices about task configuration without
   coordinating with clients.

   One consequence of late binding is the scope of anti-replay
   protections needs to much broader.  For this, scoping report
   extensions (Section 5) are defined to help constrain the scope of
   reports over which replay protection operates.

   For differential privacy, its effective implementation depends on
   being able to limit contributions from participants, or set bounds on
   sensitivity.  The basic mechanism that DAP uses to cap contributions
   is record anti-replay.  Aggregators are responsible for ensuring that
   the same report cannot be aggregated more than once.  An honest
   participant will contribute a limited number of reports and can rely
   on at least one aggregator preventing each report from being used
   multiple times.

   The default configuration of DAP also depends on having differential
   privacy configuration known to clients when reports are generated.
   Clients need to know the parameters of the differential privacy
   mechanism that is configured so that they can properly account for
   any privacy loss.  This can limit the applicability of the protocol
   outside of certain narrow patterns.

   This document defines extensions to DAP that allow reports to be
   bound to a specific amount of differential privacy budget expenditure
   (Section 4).  For cases where the DAP aggregators are responsible for
   applying the differential privacy mechanism -- namely the addition of
   noise -- this ensures that clients can depend on the correct amount
   of noise being applied.

   For a differentially-private system, scoping extensions (Section 5)
   can be essential.  Scoping constraints can be used to ensure that
   contributions from different contexts are not combined in a way that
   would cause sensitivity bounds to be exceeded.

   This document also defines a task provisioning extension (see
   Section 3.3 of [TASKPROV]) that lists the report extensions that need
   to included in every report.  These task extensions also set
   constraints on the value of those report extensions.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Late Task Binding

   DAP presently requires that a client be aware of the task that it is
   contributing to.  The identity of the task is bound to each report
   through the inclusion of the task ID in the call to the sharding
   function of the Verifiable Distributed Aggregation Function (VDAF);
   see Section 5.1 of [VDAF].

   The late_binding report extension (codepoint 0xTBD) signals to
   aggregators that a report was not bound to a specific task when it
   was created.

   Late task binding might be useful when reports are collected by an
   intermediary.  The client that generates the report in this case
   might be unaware of how the report will ultimately be aggregated.
   This allows the intermediary to defer the creation of a task until it
   has determined the necessary parameters for the task.

   When sharding and protecting reports, the task ID is replaced with a
   the fixed, 32-byte sequence of
   b13e8440f1cdb4da51eed3967e0a2652d27f5005bc35f751daf188b4b746708b (in
   hex).  Specifically, this includes the task_id that is passed to the
   Vdaf.shard function and is encoded in the InputShareAad struct; see
   Section 4.5.2 of [DAP].

      |  This is the output from SHA-256 [SHA2] when passed an ASCII-
      |  encoded [ASCII] input of 'no task_id'.

   Removing the binding of reports to tasks means that a report might be
   aggregated across any task that permits the use of this extension.

   Binding reports to tasks is defense against attacks that misdirect
   reports to unintended reports, including those configured with weaker
   security margins.  The best defense against this is to ensure that
   all tasks that use this are configured with roughly equivalent
   parameters.  Spoiling of results through misdirection is safeguarded
   by the verification that is performed at the preparation phase of the
   VDAF.

   Misdirecting reports this way can still lead to limited spoiling of
   tasks, within the bounds permitted for a single task.  However, any
   entity that can perform such redirection is potentially able to
   effect the same outcome more effectively through entirely falsified
   reports.

   Enforcing anti-replay for tasks that are configured to accept reports
   with this extension cannot be applied on a per-task scope.  A single
   anti-replay state MUST be used for all reports that include the
   late_binding report extension.

   This could increase the cost of meeting anti-replay requirements.
   The intent with this extension is that additional constraints, such
   as one or more of the scoping extensions (see Section 5), will be
   used to make it more feasible for an aggregator to comply with anti-
   replay requirements.

4.  Privacy Budget Consumption

   The gathering of reports can be modeled as the expenditure of privacy
   budget by a client.  That is, clients treat the creation of a report
   from private information as a limited release of information.

   Total privacy loss in this case is determined by the combination of
   two factors:

   *  How the report is aggregated.

   *  How many reports are produced.

   If aggregation includes the application of an appropriate
   differential privacy mechanism (that is, added noise; see [DWORK],
   [DAP-DP], and Section 8.5 of [DAP]), the client might rely on an
   understanding of that mechanism to model privacy loss.  However,
   without finer controls, clients need to attribute a fixed privacy
   loss to each report.  Consequently, the client needs to limit the
   number of reports it generates.

   A budget ensures that the total privacy loss can be bounded while
   providing more flexibility in how reports are constructed.  Privacy
   loss associated with any report (or information release) can be
   adjusted.  Importantly, the amount of noise added to aggregates is
   based on the expended budget.  In general, spending more privacy
   budget means that less noise is needed to maintain the same level of
   privacy; conversely, spending less budget means more noise.

   A budget might be specified in terms of a metric (like the epsilon
   parameter in (ε, δ)-differential privacy) that is expended with each
   information release.

   For example, for an overall budget of ε=10 might be split four ways:
   (0.5, 1.5, 2, 6).  Noise might then be added, drawing from a
   distribution with a width inversely proportional to the budget spent;
   that is, a distribution with a standard deviation proportional to 2,
   2/3, 1/2, and 1/6 respectively.

   This extension gives clients the ability to manage privacy budget
   expenditure.  By binding the amount of budget spent to each report,
   the client can transfer responsibility for applying differential
   privacy to the aggregation service.  The addition of noise by the
   aggregation service can ensure a better trade-off between the amount
   of added noise and privacy parameters.

4.1.  Privacy Budget Report Extension Format

   The privacy_budget report extension (codepoint 0xTBD) encodes the
   amount of privacy budget that the client considers to be expended as
   a result of producing a report.

   The value of the codepoint is an encoding of the number of micro-
   epsilons of budget that are expended, using as many bytes as needed
   to encode the value in network byte order.  Each unit is a one-
   millionth of an epsilon (ε) as used in (ε, δ)-differential privacy.

   The micro-epsilon value is encoded as a 32-bit integer in network
   byte order.  This permits the expenditure of up to ε=4294.967295.

      |  Note: A separate report extension could be defined to change
      |  the scale of this value or switch to a different unit, as
      |  necessary.

   The delta (δ) parameter is not directly bound to reports.  This
   parameter is rarely used in privacy budgeting.  A maximum value might
   be fixed as part of the system, with the final value being chosen
   based on the total report volume and -- where applicable -- the total
   number of tasks that each client might contribute to.

      |  Note: Where the delta (δ) value is non-zero, and a client might
      |  generate many reports, clients might also need to limit the
      |  number of reports to prevent the overall delta value from
      |  growing large.

4.2.  Privacy Budget Usage

   An aggregator that is configured to apply a differential privacy
   mechanism can operate in one of two modes: either one where the
   privacy budget value is validated and reports that contain a small
   value are rejected; or, where the minimum privacy budget value is
   used to determine the parameters for the differential privacy
   mechanism.

   In the first mode, aggregators each validate this parameter as part
   of validating each report.  The value in the report is compared with
   the value configured for the task.  A report that contains a value
   that is lower than the value configured for the task is the result of
   a client that expects that the aggregators will add more noise than
   the task configuration presently allows.  Aggregators MUST reject
   reports with a privacy budget value that is smaller than their
   configured privacy budget.

   Alternatively, aggregators could adjust the parameters of the
   differential privacy mechanism they use to match the smallest privacy
   budget that was included in reports.  For long-running tasks that
   produce multiple outputs over time, it is only necessary to ensure
   that each output contain noise that is based on the minimum budget
   expenditure of the reports that are included in that aggregate.

   This report extension can be used to protect reports that are
   conveyed from client by untrusted entities, especially where those
   entities might be able to choose any task, as enabled by the
   late_binding report extension (Section 3).  This parameter ensures
   that the entity cannot direct reports to a task that has an
   inadequate differential privacy mechanism.

5.  Scoping Extensions

   The DAP report extensions in this section might be used to either
   constrain the use of reports for tasks that are configured with
   matching values or group reports for the purposes of detecting
   duplicates.

   Including additional scoping information can also ensure that reports
   do not get reused outside of their intended scope.

   This section defines report extensions that carry requester identity
   (Section 5.1) and report partition (Section 5.2).

5.1.  Requester (Website) Identity

   Reports might be requested by an entity that operates at lower trust
   level than the entity that assembles the report.  The entity at the
   lower trust level might not have access to the information necessary
   to generate the report.

   The requester_identity report extension (codepoint 0xTBD) contains an
   encoding of the entity that requested the report be created.

   For example, an application could ask the operating system to
   generate a report using information that would normally be withheld
   from it.  Similarly, a website could ask a web browser to generate a
   report based on otherwise secret information.  In either case, the
   release of information for report is conditional on it only being
   used by a specific aggregation service under terms that have been
   previously established with the aggregators.  Binding the report to
   the identity of the requester ensures that any use of the system can
   be accounted for as coming from that requester.

   The specific encoding used in this extension will depend on the
   application.  This extension therefore contains a sequence of
   application-defined bytes.  However, the use of a globally-unique
   identifier, such as an origin ([ORIGIN]) or serialized site ([SITE]),
   reduces the likelihood of name collisions.  A name collision might
   either allow two requesters that share an aggregator to share and
   reuse each others reports (or perhaps to marginally increase the odds
   of having reports spuriously detected duplicates).

5.2.  Report Partition

   This extension allows a client to bind a report to an application-
   defined label.  This allows applications to partition reports and
   have each partition managed separately.

   The report_partition report extension (codepoint 0xTBD) contains an
   application-defined sequence of bytes.

   The use of this report extension allows aggregators to partition
   their state for tracking reports.  Duplicate reports only need to be
   tracked across a matching partition, for detecting duplicates within
   a task or for detecting duplicates across tasks.

   The selection of partition values might need to be coordinated with
   aggregators.  If partitions are used by aggregators, the amount of
   state the aggregator tracks is increased by the number of partitions.
   This represents an increase in total storage, in exchange for
   reducing the scope over which that storage needs to be consistent.

   An aggregator could constrain the values that are accepted for this
   extension, rejecting reports that lack the extension or have
   disallowed values.

6.  Task Configuration Extensions

   DAP tasks that are created with the DAP task configuration extension
   [TASKPROV] can set constraints on the reports that are accepted for a
   task.

   enum {
     task_budget (0xTBD),
     single_requester (0xTBD),
     (2^16-1)
   } ExtensionType;

   uint16 ReportExtensions<2..2^16-2>;

   Task provisioning extensions are defined that govern the use of the
   privacy_budget (Section 4) and requester_identity (Section 5.1)
   report extensions.  These task provisioning extensions ensure that
   reports submitted to the task include the corresponding report
   extensions and that reports with invalid values are rejected.

6.1.  Privacy Budget Task Extension

   The task_budget task provisioning extension contains the minimum
   privacy budget that can be expended on the task.  The value is
   encoded identically to the privacy_budget report extension; see
   Section 4.

   The task_budget task provisioning extension both establishes a
   requirement for reports to include the privacy_budget report
   extension and sets an upper bound on the amount of privacy budget
   that can be expended.  Reports that contain no privacy_budget report
   extension or those that contain a privacy_budget report extension
   value smaller than the value in the task_budget extension MUST be
   rejected.

   The value of this extension can be used to bound the noise that is
   applied by a centrally managed differential privacy mechanism.
   Aggregators use the minimum value across all submitted reports to
   determine how much noise is added; setting a minimum budget allows
   that noise to be bounded.

6.2.  Single Requester Task Extension

   This single_requester task provisioning extension contains the
   identity of a requester.  The format of this is identical to the
   requester_identity report extension; see Section 5.1.

   Use of this extension indicates that all reports submitted to the
   task MUST include a requester_identity report extension with the
   specified value.  All reports that omit that extension or contain a
   different value MUST be rejected.

7.  Security Considerations

   Security factors specific to each extension is enumerated in the
   respective sections: Section 3, Section 5.1, Section 5.2, and
   Section 4.

   Use of DAP is subject to the security considerations of DAP
   (Section 8 of [DAP]) and the VDAF that is in use (Section 9 of
   [VDAF].

8.  IANA Considerations

   Identifiers" registry established in Section 9.2.2 of [DAP].
