     Distributed Aggregation Protocol (DAP) Extensions for Improved
                  Application of Differential Privacy
                  draft-thomson-ppm-dap-dp-ext-latest

Abstract

   The Distributed Aggregation Protocol (DAP) can be a key component of
   a system that provides differentially-private guarantees for
   participants.  Extensions to DAP are defined to support these
   guarantees.  This includes bindings of measurements to specific
   options, so that the aggregation service can better implement privacy
   budgeting and replay protections.

1.  Introduction

   The Distributed Aggregation Protocol (DAP) [DAP] can be used as part
   of a differentially-private system.

   Differential privacy depends on being able to limit the contributions
   from participants.  The basic mechanism that DAP uses to cap
   contributions is anti-replay.  Aggregators are responsible for
   ensuring that the same measurement cannot be aggregated more than
   once.  An honest participant will contribute a limited number of
   measurements and can rely on at least one aggregator preventing that
   measurement from being used multiple times.  (The threat model does
   not seek to protect the privacy of a dishonest participant.)

   This basic anti-replay mechanism allows DAP to provide caps on
   contributions.  The resulting system is somewhat inflexible, which
   can limit the applicability of the protocol outside of the narrowly-
   defined usage modes in the basic specification.

   This document defines several upload extensions to DAP that either
   enable greater flexibility or help constrain the flexibility allowed
   by other options.

      |  TODO: It would make sense for the corresponding extensions to
      |  be added to [TASKPROV].  However, that protocol does not
      |  include any provision for extensions.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Late Task Binding

   DAP presently requires that a client be aware of the task that it is
   contributing to.  The identity of the task is bound to each
   measurement through the inclusion of the task ID in the call to the
   sharding function of the VDAF (Section 5.1 of [VDAF]).

   The late-binding extension (codepoint 0xTBD) signals to aggregators
   that a measurement was not bound to a specific task when it was
   created.

   Late binding might be useful when measurements are collected by an
   intermediary, where the client that generates the measurement is not
   aware of how the measurement will ultimately be aggregated.  This
   allows the intermediary to defer the creation of a task until it has
   determined the necessary parameters for the task.

   When sharding and protecting measurements, the task ID is replaced
   with a the fixed, 32-byte sequence of
   b13e8440f1cdb4da51eed3967e0a2652d27f5005bc35f751daf188b4b746708b (in
   hex).  (This is the output from SHA-256 [SHA2] when passed an ASCII-
   encoded [ASCII] input of 'no task_id'.)

   Enforcing anti-replay for a measurement that is not bound to a
   specific task is challenging.  An aggregator cannot constrain its
   search for duplicate measurements to those that were submitted to the
   task.  This could greatly increase the cost of meeting anti-replay
   requirements.  The intent with this extension is that additional
   constraints, such as one or more of the scoping extensions (see
   Section 4), will be used to make it more feasible for an aggregator
   to comply with anti-replay requirements.

4.  Scoping Extensions

   The DAP upload extensions in this section might be used to either
   constrain the use of measurements for tasks that are configured with
   matching values or group measurements for the purposes of detecting
   duplicates.

   Including additional scoping information can also ensure that
   measurements do not get reused outside of their intended scope.

4.1.  Requester (Website) Identity

   Measurements might be requested by an entity that operates at lower
   trust level than the entity that assembles the measurement.  The
   entity at the lower trust level might not have access to the
   information necessary to generate the measurement.

   For example, an application could ask the operating system to
   generate a measurement using information that would normally be
   withheld from it.  Similarly, a website could ask a web browser to
   generate a measurement.  In either case, the release of information
   for measurement is conditional on it only being used by a specific
   aggregation service under terms that have been previously established
   with the aggregators.  Binding the measurement to the identity of the
   requester ensures that any use of the system can be accounted for as
   coming from that requester.

   The specific encoding used in this extension will depend on the
   application.  However, the use of a globally-unique identifier, such
   as an origin ([ORIGIN]) or serialized site ([SITE]), reduces the odds
   of name collisions.  A name collision might either allow two
   requesters that share an aggregator to share and reuse each others
   measurements (or perhaps to marginally increase the odds of having
   measurements spuriously detected duplicates).

4.2.  Thread

5.  Privacy Budget

6.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

7.  IANA Considerations

   Registrations for the defined upload extensions need to be made, but
   this depends on the resolution of the TODO in Section 8.2.2 of [DAP].
